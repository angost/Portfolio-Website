            "description_long": "Simple, fun project to simulate fish swimming in a closed environment. Created in Python using Pygame - library for games. Fish are represented as objects, with different types of fish being seperate subclasses (they differ in speed, size and looks). You can specify number of fish to spawn. When the simulation starts, spawned fish start to move around the screen, changing direction if they reach the edge. Each fish starts with a certain level of hunger, which gets higher by eating other fish and lower by swimming. It is represented by a colorful circle around the fish. When hunger becomes too low a method is called, which looks for nearest (smallest difference in x and y position) smaller fish. Then it targets it and changes movement pattern from free swimming to chasing targeted prey. When a fish gets eaten, it becomes a corpse and slowly falls down the screen. Attacker's hunger goes up, and it becomes larger. There's also an option to spawn food next to mouse cursor by clicking its left button, and making all the fish follow the mouse cursor while right mouse button is pressed.",

A question is displayed on a card, frased like 'Would you like to have a picnic outside with your parner?'. A person can drag the card to one of four areas on the screen, representing willingness to do the activity ('very much', 'okay', 'definitely not', ' I can if you want to') which are converted into a number from 1 to 4. Questions are coded and stored in a csv file (index, content). Answers are stored in a seperate csv file (index, person1answer, person2answer), which, after being updated with new answers, is pushed to a github repository. When the other user opens the app, any changes are pulled from the repo. Users can then open a 'Matches' tab, on which all answered questions are displayed in a list, with a compatibility graph on the right. Answers can be sorted by date, by compatibility and marked as favourites. There is also an option to send a request - a custom question from one partner to another, which is marked as 4 (very likely to do it) for the sender, and ? for the receiver. The receiver will respond to the request during the next set of questions.",

There are a couple types of vehicles (Bike, Electric Bike, Scooter, Electric Scooter), each of them inherits from an abstract Vehicle class. Information on stations (stats, currently availible vehicles), users (stats, currently reserved and rented vehicles) etc. is stored in a group of txt files, in a complete and well-thought-out manner.

Working with bitmap images required analising the structure of a file (header, DIB header, pixel array, padding).\nImplementing iterative flood fill algorithm: Given coordinates of starting pixel, add bordering pixels to queue. For each pixel in queue, if it's in the same color as starting pixel, recolor it and add bordering pixels to queue. Remove analized pixel from queue.",
